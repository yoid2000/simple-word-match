# simple-word-match

On my linux machine, the repo is at `/opt/simple-word-match`

There is a service file at: `sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/simple-word-match.service`


To reload systemd to apply the new service, start the service, and enable it to run on boot:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start simple-word-match
sudo systemctl enable simple-word-match
```

(Note that specifically it is the enable that enables to rerun on boot)

To check if the service is running:

`sudo systemctl status simple-word-match`

Don't forget that gunicorn needs to be installed in the venv:

pip install gunicorn

To stop the service:

`sudo systemctl stop simple-word-match`

To restart the service:

`sudo systemctl restart simple-word-match`
